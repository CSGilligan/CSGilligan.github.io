Boston's modest losses were more in line with the mid-tier cities. </p> <br> <iframe title="While expensive cities got more affordable and affordable cities got more expensive, Boston stood pat" aria-label="chart" id="datawrapper-chart-6xrMt" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/6xrMt/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border:none;" width="600" height="600"></iframe> <br> <br> <p> The modest changes reflect a stubbornly expensive market despite Boston's size - ranking 21st in the country in population, Boston is at the top of the pack with New York, while other major population and cultural centers like Los Angeles and Chicago are profoundly more affordable in comparison. </p> <br> <iframe title="Boston is a mid-size city with top-tier rent prices" aria-label="chart" id="datawrapper-chart-ZQVRj" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ZQVRj/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border:none;" width="600" height="560"></iframe> <br> <br> <p> As Boston's population grows and housing demands increase, there are increasingly fewer options for renters who are looking for affordable neighborhoods. Boston's historically more reasonably priced neighborhoods, including Brighton and neighboring Allston, as well as parts of South Boston, Roxbury, and Dorchester, saw pronounced changes in mean household income from 2013-2018. </p> <br> <iframe title="Boston isn't getting any cheaper" aria-label="chart" id="datawrapper-chart-iLzK5" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/iLzK5/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border:none;" width="600" height="600"></iframe> <br> <br> </body></html> </div> </div> </div> </div>   <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js" integrity="sha384-q8i/X+965DzO0rT7abK41JStQIAqVgRVzpbzo5smXKp4YfRvH+8abtTE1Pi6jizo" crossorigin></script> <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.3/umd/popper.min.js" integrity="sha384-ZMP7rVo3mIykV+2+9J3UJ46jBk0WLaUAdn689aCwoqbBJiSnjAK/l8WvCWPIPm49" crossorigin></script> <script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.1.1/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha384-smHYKdLADwkXOn1EmN1qk/HfnUcbVRZyYmZ4qpPea6sjB/pTJ0euyQp0Mk8ck+5T" crossorigin></script> </body></html>
