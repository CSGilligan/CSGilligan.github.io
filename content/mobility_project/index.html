<p> <i>This visual shows each MLB team's path of postseason success in the Division Series era (from 1995-present). The Wild Card Game was introduced in 2012.</i></p>

<p> <i>Below, the visual is recreated for the NBA, showing the current era beginning with the 2003 playoffs, when the first round was expanded to seven games.</i></p>

    <p> <i>MLB teams appear to have more volatile playoff results year-to-year, with teams somewhat frequently passing from World Series contenders to missing the playoffs, and vice versa, and most teams showing at least two playoff-contending windows in this time period. The NBA, by comparison, seems to show more stable windows of contention, with teams more often reaching the postseason for periods of a number of years at a time, and much more frequently repeating Finals appearances.</i></p>
